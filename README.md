# Course Outline AI Microservices System

## Introduction

This is a microservices-based system designed for university students to upload their course outlines and receive
AI-generated notes and revision questions.
The platform leverages modern technologies such as Java Spring Boot, Kafka, and OpenAI APIs to provide a seamless experience for students and educators.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Role-based access control (e.g., students, admins).
- **Course Outline Management**: Upload and store course outlines.
- **AI-Powered Content Generation**: Generate well-articulated notes and solved revision questions using OpenAI API.
- **Interactive Revision Platform**: Quiz-based revision with real-time feedback.
- **Notifications**: Email and SMS notifications for students.
- **Search and Recommendations**: Quickly find notes and get related content.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Track usage statistics and generate reports.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a **microservices architecture** with the following components:

1. **Authentication & User Management Service**
   - Handles user registration, login, and role management.

2. **Course Outline Management Service**
   - Manages the upload and storage of course outlines.

3. **Content Generation Service**
   - Connects to OpenAI API to generate notes and revision content.

4. **Notes and Content Management Service**
   - Stores and manages the generated content.

5. **Search and Recommendation Service**
   - Provides search and personalized recommendations.

6. **Notification Service**
   - Sends notifications to users when content is ready.

7. **Analytics and Reporting Service**
   - Tracks system usage and generates reports.

8. **Revision Quiz Service**
   - Enables students to take quizzes based on generated revision content.

9. **File Storage Service**
   - Manages storage of course outlines and notes.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kafka and Zookeeper
- MySQL and MongoDB
- OpenAI API Key

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file with the following:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     MYSQL_USER=root
     MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
     KAFKA_BROKER=kafka:9092
     ```

3. Start services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. Run each microservice:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Service
- `POST /register` - Register a new user
- `POST /login` - Authenticate a user

### Course Outline Service
- `POST /course-outline/upload` - Upload a course outline
- `GET /course-outline/{id}` - Retrieve a specific course outline

### Content Generation Service

## Event Flows (Kafka)

1. **Course Outline Uploaded**:
   - Producer: Course Outline Service → `course-outline-events` topic
   - Consumer: Content Generation Service

2. **Notes Generated**:
   - Producer: Content Generation Service → `notes-events` topic
   - Consumer: Notification Service

3. **Analytics Events**:
   - Producers: Notes Management Service, Quiz Service → `analytics-events` topic
   - Consumer: Analytics and Reporting Service

---

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Stable production-ready code
- `dev` - Development branch for feature integration
- Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`

### Code Contribution
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. Commit changes and push:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add <feature>"
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```

4. Create a pull request.

---

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Run with:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

- **Integration Tests**: Ensure services work together.

- **Kafka Event Testing**: Use a Kafka testing tool (e.g., Kafka Streams TestUtils).

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add real-time collaborative note editing.
- Integrate machine learning models for personalized recommendations.
- Add support for multiple languages.
